## EDA and Linear models on Craiglist Housing Data

This project looks at housing rent data scraped from Craiglist in New York and San Francisco. The goal of this project is twofold: to build interesting visuzalizations of the data and also to build machine learning models that predict whether a given new listing is fair.

It uses a modified version of the [craigslist python package](https://github.com/juliomalegria/python-craigslist) to also scrape the square footage and number of bedrooms. Pandas is used for data cleaning and visualization and scikit learn is used for language processing and the models.

You can check the main EDA [here](https://github.com/apapiu/Craiglist_Project/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Main%20EDA%20NYC%2BSF.ipynb) and look at how well some linear models do [here](https://github.com/apapiu/Craiglist_Project/blob/master/Models/Models.ipynb). You can also just check the visualizations below :)
